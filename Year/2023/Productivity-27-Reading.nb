\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]So we shall now explain how to read the book. The \
right way is to put it on your desk during the day, below your pillow at \
night, devoting yourself to the reading, and solving the exercises until you \
know it by heart. Unfortunately, I suspect the reader is looking for advice \
on how not to read, i.e. what to skip, and even better, how to read only some \
isolated highlights.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] - Saharon Shelah, \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Classification Theory and the Number of Non-Isomorphic \
Models\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Never read a book that can be adequately summarised.
Never read a book you would not reread.
No book that can be shortened survives.
Never read a book written by a journalist.
Never read a book if you understand the table of contents.
Never read a textbook as if you are reading a books.
Never read a textbook in the sequence prescribed by the authors.
Never read a book if you know what you are getting out of it.
Never read a book if you do not expect to be surprised by something in it \
while reading it.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]..reading a book doesn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t mean just \
turning the pages. It means thinking about it, 
identifying parts that you want to go back to, asking how to place it 
in a broader context, pursuing the ideas. There\[CloseCurlyQuote]s no point \
in reading 
a book if you let it pass before your eyes and then forget about it 
ten minutes later. Reading a book is an intellectual exercise, 
which stimulates thought, questions, imagination.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] 

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Avoid discussing anything I did not either personally \
witness or develop independently, anything
I have not distilled well enough to write with only the slightest effort. \
Everything that felt
like work was out. Purge passages that seem to come from a visit to the \
library. Use no quote that
did not naturally spring from memory and did not come from a writer that I \
have intimately frequented over
the years. Detest the random use of borrowed wisdoms. Either keep silence, or \
say something better than silence.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

It is my hope that this discussion here will galvanize you to be patient with \
your responsibility to work with abstract ideas as a new language. This \
article is the result of my motivation to read better now that I regret that \
I did not try to build my foundation in reading early on, now that I need to \
revise this knowledge for higher-level courses.

The core tendencies I find advisable for readers are to (1) exercise patience \
as an exploration in learning the words of an abstract language, (2) to find \
comfort in solving exercises and interacting with the larger concepts first \
before detailed computation. The treatment of abstract concepts as a language \
is under-addressed when trying to learn new mathematics. I by no means claim \
that this is chiefly the source of intimidation with abstraction, and \
instead, claim that these are the two tendencies that we should strive for as \
readers of abstract ideas in science, mathematics, and engineering. In \
summary, I have faith that you can describe and summarize long calculations \
with verbiage and terminology that is concise enough to keep you engaged with \
the book. The first claim I make is that the solution of exercises is \
primarily to help you feel at ease with the process of rendering the problem \
tractable in your mind with clear and concise shorthand. I believe this is \
true since I find that it is important that you can explain clearly the \
application of the solution techniques and that one can grow and be competent \
in this regard.

In that sense, I think that exercises should aid you in learning the language \
that clarifies the technical details in problem-solving. By no means do I \
think this prescription is applicable to all readers, however, I find that it \
is helpful to only write down what is really necessary after solving the \
problem in your head already is helpful. For example, you can write down the \
majority of the computations and leave the big ideas in your head to mull \
over. It is normal to feel threatened by an excessive number of exercises. \
You should solve enough problems to validate your confidence with as much \
effort as you think is suitable for you. This naturalistic tendency helps you \
be confident in making tradeoffs with your time and accept that partial \
progress is still beneficial for your learning. I hope to be able to comfort \
you that the slow process to read is normal. Even on pages with little \
technical detail, I find myself spending half an hour revising the ideas \
presented with reference to the glossary. It is great to be optimistic and \
ambitious in your efforts to (1) try to understand every word on each page, \
(2) come up with questions and discussion points that address each important \
idea, (3) and come up with new definitions that truncate and summarize swaths \
of discussions. In particular, the verbiage that you adopt can hopefully help \
you comfortably summarize calculations and solution techniques with your \
friends.

It is observed that many techniques and theorems that are abstract are named \
after people to celebrate their achievement. But, it is encouraged that you \
try to find a shorthand to describe these ideas with more visceral imagery \
and related concepts.

Another interesting point is that you can have faith in yourself to \
concentrate on more advanced material that can help you internalize difficult \
arguments more quickly. You do not need to work your way up necessarily all \
the time. You can learn the basics while assimilating harder material too! \
One thing I have found helpful is to read notes line by line and stop at any \
point where you do not follow the argument. Ask yourself every question you \
can think of. If you feel sensitive or anxious with this process, try \
consulting the glossary to revise what each word means. It is praiseworthy \
and helpful to work through all arguments or proofs, step by step, line by \
line. You should not feel discouraged if you need to stare at the words while \
seeking the basic ideas and intuitive interpretations. Hopefully, with \
sufficient consultation with the glossary, you will be motivated to find \
simplified definitions that summarize larger swaths of information. It is \
normal to begin with the simplest examples as you try to interpret line by \
line of each argument. I believe you can grow to expect yourself to be able \
to work through arguments and answer questions on computations to attain a \
sustained understanding of concepts. It is also helpful that you make up \
definitions or words for routine computations that are not adequately defined.

I understand that it is stressful to have you understand material with too \
many complicated things; if you feel anxious about complexity when reading, \
you can skip using pen and paper if you do not feel comfortable. The material \
may seem difficult, but if you read it slowly you will understand it all. I \
have faith that you will naturally think of the big picture if you read in \
detail already, and it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s okay to accept your anxiety if you \
find that you cannot get the big picture straight away. There is no need to \
skim as long as you are patient and at ease. Be patient with yourself. You \
can definitely understand ideas that you do not get straight away with enough \
time, patience, and diligence. Alternative definitions for various things are \
very enjoyable, it is fun and instructive to compare and contrast the \
convenience in how these definitions summarize and make important ideas \
behave in different contexts. Also, if a proof is included in the book, you \
do not have to worry, as it is likely that it is not expected for you to come \
up with the proof on your own.

I can empathize from personal experience that the allocation of time is very \
difficult and stressful to you with regards to deadlines. I think it is okay \
to be behind time to build a greater understanding of the topic. It will be \
well worth it, especially since you will pick up speed later. You will have a \
rich understanding of a topic and build on prior knowledge more easily and \
explain concepts clearly. You do not need to make speed a particular \
competition with others.

A few practical stories of people who worked all the problems and got the \
benefit:

Freeman Dyson worked all the ODE problems in an ODE book over winter break, \
teaching himself the subject. He enjoyed it and benefited from it.

Richard Feynman felt he needed to learn classical E&M better when developing \
QED. He worked every problem in a conventional E&M text. He also worked every \
problem in calculus texts and in quantum theory.

Lars Onsanger did all the problems in Whitacker and Watson.
