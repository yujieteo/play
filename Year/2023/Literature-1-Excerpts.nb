\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The words \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]No Radio\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] refer to a sign people put in their cars in New York \
City. It means \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t bother breaking \
into the body of this car; the radio has already been either stolen or else \
removed by the owner.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]... this image because it speaks \
to the reservations many still feel about \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]theory\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] and about its association with the ideology of \
mastery through critical analysis that murders to dissect... We would not \
summon the image if we did not feel that \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]theory\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] is itself filled with doubt regarding the \
objectivist ideal the image so carefully mocks. Some theories do indeed \
fulfil the aspirations of the man with the heart in his hand, but we hope you \
will feel that there are many others in this book that adopt the perspective \
of the woman on the table.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]
Formalisms: Russian Formalisms and New Criticisms
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]If the author emerges by addressing the reader, by \
commenting on the action, by reflections, etc., the reader will bridge the \
gap between his own world and fictional reality under the guidance, so to \
speak, of the author. This is authorial narration. If the reader has the \
illusion of being present on the scene in one of the figures (characters), \
then figural narration is taking place. If the point of observation does not \
lie in any of the novel\[CloseCurlyQuote]s figures, although the perspective \
gives the reader the feeling of being pre- sent as an imaginary witness of \
the events then the presentation can be called neutral.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]
Structuralism, Linguistics, Narratology
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]There is the notion of \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]spirit,\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] which enables us to establish between the \
simultaneous or successive phenomena of a given period a community of \
meanings, symbolic links, an interplay of resemblance and reflexion, or which \
allows the sovereignty of collective consciousness to emerge as the principle \
of unity and explanation. We must question those ready-made syntheses, those \
groupings that we normally accept before any examination, those links whose \
validity is recognized from the outset. We must oust those forms and obscure \
forces by which we usually link the discourse of one man with that of \
another; they must be driven out from the darkness in which they reign. And \
instead of giving them unqualified, spontaneous value, we must accept, in the \
name of methodological rigor, that, in the first instance, they concern only \
a population of dispersed events.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]1) Language is a well-defined object in the \
heterogeneous mass of speech facts. It can be localized in the limited \
segment of the speaking-circuit where an auditory image becomes associated \
with a concept. It is the social side of speech, outside the individual who \
can never create nor modify it by himself; it exists only by virtue of a sort \
of contract signed by the members of a community. Moreover, the individual \
must always serve an apprenticeship to learn the functioning of language; a \
child assimilates it only gradually. It is such a distinct thing that a man \
deprived of the use of speaking retains it if he understands the vocal signs \
that he hears. (2) Language, unlike speaking, is something that we can study \
separately. Although dead languages are no longer spoken, we can easily \
assimilate their linguistic organisms. We can dispense with the other \
elements of speech; indeed, the science of language is possible only if the \
other elements are excluded. (3) Whereas speech is heterogeneous, language, \
as defined, is homogeneous. It is a system of signs in which the only \
essential thing is the union of meanings and sound- images, and in which both \
parts of the sign are psychological.4) Language is concrete, no less so than \
speaking; and this is a help in our study of it. Linguistic signs, though \
basically psychological, are not abstractions; associations which bear the \
stamp of collective approval - and which added together constitute language - \
are realities that have their seat in the brain.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]
Rhetoric, Phenomenology, Reader-Response
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Metaphor: implied comparison for two things of unlike \
nature to have something in common. Simile is explicit metaphor. Chiasmus. \
The order in the second half of an expression reverses that of the first. \
Metonymy. Substitution of some attributive word for what is meant. Example: \
crown for royalty. Synecdoche. Substitution of part for whole, example: \
silver for money. Irony. Use of word to convey meaning opposite to the word.\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]
Poststructuralism, Deconstruction, Postmodernism
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Only, on the one hand, the process of limitation and, \
on the other, the study of the violently alternating reactions of antagonism \
(expulsion) and love (reabsorption) obtained by positing the heterogeneous \
element, lie within the province of heterology as science. This element \
itself remains indefinable and can only be determined through negation.\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Differance is the systematic play of differences, of \
the traces of differences, of the spacing by means of which elements are \
related to each other. This spacing is the simultaneously active and passive \
(the a of Differance indicates this indecision as concerns activity and \
passivity, that which cannot be governed by or distributed between the terms \
of this opposition) production of the intervals without which the \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]full\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] terms would not signify, \
would not function. It is also the becoming-space of the spoken chain - which \
has been called temporal or linear; a becoming-space which makes possible \
both writing and every correspondence between speech and writing, every \
passage from one to the other.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]
Psychoanalysis and Psychology
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Freud\[CloseCurlyQuote]s account of the boy\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Oedipus complex is relatively simple and \
straightforward.2 In response to, or in collaboration with, his heterosexual \
mother, a boy\[CloseCurlyQuote]s pre-oedipal attachment to her becomes \
charged with phallic/sexual overtones. He comes to see his father as a rival \
for his mother\[CloseCurlyQuote]s love and wishes to replace him. He \
fantasizes taking his father\[CloseCurlyQuote]s penis, murdering, or \
castrating him. He fears retaliation, and specifically castration, by his \
father for these wishes; thus, he experiences a conflict between his self- \
love (narcissistic interest in his penis and body integrity) and his love for \
his mother (libidinal cathexis). As a result, he gives up his heterosexual \
attachment to his mother, radically repressing and denying his feelings \
toward her. (These feelings are not only repressed, but also are partly \
expressed in \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]aim-inhibited\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] \
modes, in affectionate feelings and sublimated activities.) At the same time, \
a \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]successful\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] resolution of his \
Oedipus complex requires that he remain heterosexual. Therefore, he is \
supposed to detach his heterosexual orientation from his mother, so that when \
he grows up, he can reattach it to some other woman. He receives a reward for \
his self-sacrifice, in addition to his avoidance of punishment. The carrot of \
the masculine Oedipus complex is identification with his father, and the \
superiority of masculine identification and prerogatives over feminine (if \
the threat of castration is the stick). A new psychic integration appears in \
place of the Oedipus complex, as the boy\[CloseCurlyQuote]s ego is modified \
and transformed through the incorporation of paternal prohibitions to form \
his superego, and as he substitutes a general sexual orientation for the \
specific attachment to his mother (this attachment is composed of both the \
remainders of his infantile love and his newer sexualized and genitalized \
attachment).\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]
Historicisms
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]For a long time, the prevailing model for the study of \
literary sources, a model in effect parcelled out between the old historicism \
and the new criticism, blocked such a question. As a freestanding, self- \
sufficient, disinterested artwork produced by a solitary genius, King Lear \
has only an accidental relation to its sources: they provide a glimpse of the \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]raw material\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] that the artist \
fashioned. Insofar as this \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]material\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] is taken seriously at all, it is as part of the work\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]historical background,\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] a phrase that reduces history to a decorative \
setting or a convenient, well-lighted pigeonhole. But once the \
differentiations on which this model is based begin to crumble, then source \
study is compelled to change its character: history cannot simply be set \
against literary texts as either stable antithesis or stable background, and \
the protective isolation of those texts gives way to a sense of their \
interaction with other texts and hence of the permeability of their \
boundaries.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]
Political Criticism: Marxism to Cultural Materialism
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Let me summarize what we have discovered about \
ideology in general. The duplicate mirror-structure of ideology ensures \
simultaneously: 1 the interpellation of \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]individuals\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] as subjects; 2 their subjection to the Subject; 3 \
the mutual recognition of subjects and Subject, the \
subjects\[CloseCurlyQuote] recognition of each other, and finally the subject\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s recognition of himself; 4 the absolute guarantee that \
everything really is so, and that on condition that the subjects recognize \
what they are and behave accordingly, everything will be all right: Amen - \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]So be it.\[CloseCurlyQuote]\[CloseCurlyQuote]\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The usual interpretation of this dream is based on a \
thesis that one of the functions of the dream is to enable the dreamer to \
prolong his sleep. The sleeper is suddenly exposed to an exterior irritation, \
a stimulus coming from reality (the ringing of an alarm clock, knocking on \
the door, or, in this case, the smell of smoke), and to prolong his sleep he \
quickly, on the spot, constructs a dream: a little scene, a small story, \
which includes this irritating element. However, the external irritation soon \
becomes too strong, and the subject is awakened. The Lacanian reading is \
directly opposed to this. The subject does not awake himself when the \
external irritation becomes too strong; the logic of his awakening is quite \
different. First, he constructs a dream, a story which enables him to prolong \
his sleep, to avoid awakening into reality. But the thing that he encounters \
in the dream, the reality of his desire, the Lacanian Real - in our case, the \
reality of the child\[CloseCurlyQuote]s reproach to his father, \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Can\[CloseCurlyQuote]t you see that I am burning?,\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] implying the father\[CloseCurlyQuote]s fundamental \
guilt - is more terrifying than so-called external reality itself, and that \
is why he awakens: to escape the Real of his desire, which announces itself \
in the terrifying dream. He escapes into so- called reality to be able to \
continue to sleep, to maintain his blindness, to elude awakening into the \
Real of his desire. We can rephrase here the old \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]hippy\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] motto of the 1960s: reality is for those who cannot \
support [tolerate] the dream. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Reality\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] is a fantasy- construction which enables us to mask \
the Real of our desire.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The Lacanian thesis is, on the contrary, that there is \
always a hard kernel, a leftover which persists and cannot be reduced to a \
universal play of illusory mirroring. The difference between Lacan and \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]naive realism\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] is that for \
Lacan, the only point at which we approach this hard kernel of the Real is \
indeed the dream. When we awaken into reality after a dream, we usually say \
to ourselves \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]it was just a dream,\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] thereby blinding ourselves to the fact that in our \
everyday, wakening reality we are nothing but a consciousness of this dream. \
It was only in the dream that we approached the fantasy- framework which \
determines our activity, our mode of acting in reality itself. It is the same \
with the ideological dream, with the determination of ideology as a dreamlike \
construction hindering us from seeing the real state of things, reality as \
such. In vain do we try to break out of the ideological dream by \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]opening our eyes and trying to see reality as it is,\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] by throwing away the ideological spectacles as the \
subjects of such a post-ideological, objective, sober look, free of so-called \
ideological prejudices, as the subjects of a look which views the facts as \
they are, we remain throughout \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]the consciousness of \
our ideological dream.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] The only way to break the \
power of our ideological dream is to confront the Real of our desire which \
announces itself in this dream.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]
Feminism 
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Mother, virgin, prostitute: these are the social roles \
imposed on women. The characteristics of (so-called) feminine sexuality \
derive from them: the valorisation of reproduction and nursing; faithfulness; \
modesty, ignorance of and even lack of interest in sexual pleasure; a passive \
acceptance of men\[CloseCurlyQuote]s \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]activity\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]; seductiveness, to arouse the consumers\
\[CloseCurlyQuote] desire while offering herself as its material support \
without getting pleasure herself... Neither as mother nor as virgin nor as \
prostitute has woman any right to her own pleasure.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]But by submitting women\[CloseCurlyQuote]s bodies to a \
general equivalent, to a transcendent, supernatural value, men have drawn the \
social structure into an ever-greater process of abstraction, to the point \
where they themselves are produced in it as pure concepts: having surmounted \
all their \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]perceptible\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] \
qualities and individual differences, they are finally reduced to the average \
productivity of their labour. The power of this practical economy of the \
meta- physical comes from the fact that \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]physiological\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] energy is transformed into abstract value without \
the mediation of an intelligible elaboration.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]
Gender Studies
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]In actual fact, manifold sexualities - those which \
appear with the different ages (sexualities of the infant or the child), \
those which become fixated on particular tastes or practices (the sexuality \
of the invert, the gerontophile, the fetishist), those which, in a diffuse \
manner, invest relationships (the sexuality of doctor and patient, teacher \
and student, psychiatrist and mental patient), those which haunt spaces (the \
sexuality of the home, the school, the prison) - all form the correlate of \
exact procedures of power. We must not imagine these things that were \
formerly tolerated attracted notice and received a pejorative designation \
when the time came to give a regulative role to the one type of sexuality \
that was capable of reproducing labour power and the form of the family. \
These polymorphous conducts were extracted from people\[CloseCurlyQuote]s \
bodies and from their pleasures; or rather, they were solidified in them; \
they were drawn out, revealed, isolated, intensified, incorporated, by \
multifarious power devices. The growth of perversions is not a moralizing \
theme that obsessed the scrupulous minds of the Victorians. It is the real \
product of the encroachment of a type of power on bodies and their pleasures. \
It is possible that the West has not been capable of inventing any new \
pleasures, and it has doubtless not discovered any original vices. But it has \
defined new rules for the game of powers and pleasures. The frozen \
countenance of the perversions is a fixture of this game.\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Masculinity in this society inevitably conjures up \
notions of power and legitimacy and privilege; it often symbolically refers \
to the power of the state and to uneven distributions of wealth. Masculinity \
seems to extend outward into patriarchy and inward into the family; \
masculinity represents the power of inheritance, the consequences of the \
traffic in women, and the promise of social privilege. But, obviously, many \
other lines of identification traverse the terrain of masculinity, dividing \
its power into complicated differentials of class, race, sexuality, and \
gender.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]
Ethnic Literary and Cultural Studies, Critical Race Theory
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Probing \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]the complex formation \
of white women\[CloseCurlyQuote]s constructions of racialized selves,\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Frankenberg tries to re-historicize the categories \
of race and culture insisting on anti-essentialist conceptions of race, \
ethnicity, and culture, while at the same time emphasizing that these \
categories are made materially \[OpenCurlyQuote]real\[CloseCurlyQuote] within \
matrices of power relations.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]56 \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]It is critical to think clearly and carefully about \
the parts white people play in the maintenance of the racial order,\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Frankenberg believes, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]and to \
ask how our locations in it - and our complicity with it - are marked by \
other dimensions of our privilege and oppression, including class, gender, \
and sexuality.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Meanwhile, the recent explosion of interest in \
understudied writing receives its impetus from urgent social motives, and for \
that reason some of its proponents have tried, with deliberation or \
obliviousness, to pry aesthetic questions away from criticism. But many of us \
who recognize the social imperatives driving us to read understudied writing \
also recognize aesthetic imperatives. We like this writing. We like the \
rhythms and resonances of its phrases, sentences, episodes, and ideas. The \
politics and the aesthetics of Indian writing (or any writing) are not the \
same, but they are not separable either. The new critics and their followers \
often masked their politics by posing their political judgments as aesthetic \
judgments and pretending to write politics out of criticism. They saw \
politics as the stuff of naive criticism, especially criticism from the left. \
By contrast, scholars and teachers devoted to noncanonical literature see no \
conflict in reading politically and reading aesthetically. We read for \
politics and aesthetics, and we read the rhythms and resonances of one as \
part of reading the rhythms and resonances of the other.\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]
Colonial, Postcolonial and Transnational Studies
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The exercise of colonialist authority, however, \
requires the production of differentiations, individuations, identity effects \
through which discriminatory practices can map out subject populations that \
are tarred with the visible and transparent mark of power. Such a mode of \
subjection is distinct from what Foucault describes as \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]power through transparency\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]: \
the reign of opinion, after the late eighteenth century, which could not \
tolerate areas of darkness and sought to exercise power through the mere fact \
of things being known and people seen in an immediate, collective gaze.\
