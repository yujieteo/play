 StyleBox["***A crucial point was that all these diagrams were being produced \
algorithmically\[LongDash]with Wolfram Language code. And in fact I was \
developing the diagrams as an integral part of actually doing the research \
for the book. It was a lesson I\[CloseCurlyQuote]d learned years earlier: don\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t wait until research is \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]finished\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] to figure out how to present it; work out the \
presentation as early as possible, so you can use it to help you actually do \
the research.",

 StyleBox["\n\nAnother aspect of our first \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]textbook-like\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] style for the \
book was the idea of having additional elements, alongside the \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]main narrative\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] of the book. In \
early layouts we thought about having \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Technical Notes\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote], \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Historical Notes\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote], \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Implementation Notes\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote], etc. But it didn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t take too long \
to decide that no, that was just going to be too complicated. So we made the \
decision to have one kind of note, and to collect all notes at the back of \
the book.\n\nIt\[CloseCurlyQuote]s often assumed that the way to achieve \
maximum innovation is to put together innovative people, and then let them \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]just innovate\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] in whatever \
directions they choose. But it has been my consistent experience that the \
greatest innovation is instead achieved when there is a definite \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]flow\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] and definite, ambitious \
goals. The Wolfram Institute is going to be about doing large-scale basic \
research this way. \n\nIt\[CloseCurlyQuote]s difficult to know how society at \
large should value the general activity of basic research, and it\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s easy to criticize the inefficiencies of a large-scale \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]just let researchers do what they want\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] approach. But with the Wolfram Institute we have a \
very different model. We\[CloseCurlyQuote]re starting the institute right now \
for a specific reason: we\[CloseCurlyQuote]ve got a new paradigm that\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s just opened up an amazing collection of possibilities. \
And we plan to pursue those possibilities in an efficient and tightly managed \
way, optimized for innovation and new ideas.\n\nI said at the beginning of \
this post that the book is essentially written as a conversation. In almost \
every section, I found it convenient to add two additional parts: Q&A and \
Tech Notes. The goal of Q&A is to have a place to answer obvious questions \
people might have, without distracting from the main narrative. ",

 StyleBox["I spent a decade of my life writing A New Kind of Science. Most of \
that time was devoted to discovering the science in the book. But another \
part was spent figuring out how to present the science in the best possible \
way\[LongDash]using words and pictures.\n\nI\[CloseCurlyQuote]m constantly \
thinking about new things.  Coming up with new ideas. Getting new \
perspectives.  Thinking of new possible projects to do.\n\nUsually I don\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t talk much about things until or unless \
I\[CloseCurlyQuote]ve actually done something real with them.  Which can take \
years, and sometimes decades\[LongDash]if it happens at all.\n\nBut I\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]ve decided it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s time I started writing a \
little more about what I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m thinking about\[LongDash]rather \
than always waiting to have a complete, finished, project or product.\n\nI\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]d also like to write about some of the things that happen \
in my life.  In some ways my life is delightfully simple and ordinary.  But \
in others I\[CloseCurlyQuote]ve chosen to make it pretty far out on the \
curve.\n\nBut these seemed to have way too much \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]conceptual baggage\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote], and when \
one looks closely at them, it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s easy to get confused. I \
wanted something more minimal\[LongDash]where the spotlight was as much as \
possible on the systems I was studying, not on \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]diagrammatic scaffolding\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]. And \
so I tried to develop a \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]direct diagramming\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] methodology, where each diagram could directly \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]explain itself\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\[LongDash]and \
where every diagram would be readable \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]purely visually\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote], without words.",
