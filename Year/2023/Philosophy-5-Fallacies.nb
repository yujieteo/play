Exceptions are advocacy or commentary implicitly look one-sided since the \

Cell["\<\
Inference is not symmetric under fat-tailed domains. You need more data to \
assert that there are no Black Swans than to assert that there are Black Swans.

The probability of sampling higher than twice (2X) the random variable X once \
is higher than sampling higher than X twice in a row for an Extremistan \
distribution for large deviations. 

One test of fat-tailedness is to apply the law of large numbers to higher \
moments and see convergence. One can derive the kappa metric (rate of \
convergence of the law of large numbers for finite sums using the expected \
mean absolute deviation from the mean for a number of summands) to compare \
the distance from the limiting distribution (Levy alpha-stable basin), \
assessing the speed of law, comparing fat-tailedness or number of runs for \
Monte Carlo distribution (see Statistical Consequences of Fat Tails).

Another visualisation is to consider the contribution of the maximum to the \
total sum. This is the M-S plot. One can also compare the sample mean and \
estimated maximum likelihood mean.

Do not draw conclusions on the probability of a large deviation event in a \
fat tailed distribution.

Do not draw conclusions from invalid comparisons of a short volatility time  \
series (left skewed, exposed to sharp losses) versus a long volatility one \
(right skewed, exposed to sharp gains).

Do not ignore large deviations, especially when it indicates that a \
distribution is fat-tailed. Example: Wittgenstein\[CloseCurlyQuote]s ruler \
where a large deviation makes it Gaussian, so the table measures the ruler. \
As opposed to using a Gaussian distribution as a ruler to measure the table. \
One can attempt a plug-in by estimating the distribution and then \
extrapolating for the property. This is differentiating the true (or shadow) \
property from the realised property.

Do not fail to distinguish between calibration or probabilistic forecast \
errors from true payoffs and variations. Calibrations, a measure of one\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s prediction accuracy, lies in probability space between 0 \
and 1 and therefore is bounded.

Do not forget bounds. For example, a pandemic cannot grow exponentially, it \
follows a sigmoid due to bounds on number of people. Everything floored is \
convex, everything capped is concave.

Do not sample information in excess, especially when small deviation are have \
more sterile information compared to large deviations. Examples: arguments \
that summarise in one way, versus arguments that summarise in multiple ways \
for multiple readers.

Do not draw unfair comparisons between perishables and non-perishables. \
Nonperishable objects increase in life expectancy with each day, and cannot \
be compared with perishables.

Do not ignore multiplicative effects in distribution space. Pre-asymptotic \
failure due to state-switching and feedback loops between components such \
that thin-tailed random variables can produce multiplicative effects. \
Example: Do not compare pandemics (multiplicative) with car accidents \
(additive).

Do not confuse growth rate versus outcome since they are not in the same \
distribution class. Example: using point estimates of fatalities for a \
pandemic to manage risk, as opposed to the growth rate where errors in the \
growth rate are explosive due to exponentiation.

Do not use incorrect tail properties. Example (Lucretius): \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The fool thinks the tallest mountain there is the \
tallest mountain he has seen.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\

Do not ignore asymmetric situations where comparisons are made between \
objects where one has more to gain from volatility, randomness, errors, \
uncertainties, stressors and time. Example: false accusations causes \
irreversible reputation loss despite corrections.

Do not forget the second order implications of convexity. Example: More \
weight should be given to independent scholars conditional on the same rigor, \
due to the different risk exposures of independent scholars and academics in \
the system.

Do not prefer a false map to no map. Example: taking into account  being \
memoryless and having the gift of seeing everything as if it was the for the \
first time. Could not be married to past opinions and be married to them. \
Similarly, Soros and Montaigne had better judgment, Montaigne had the wisdom \
of explicitly attributing the property of being lacking memory to his good \
judgment and his honesty.

Do not prefer efficiency over functional redundancy or tinkering.

Do not ignore situations where we can control exposures but not do a good \
calibration or forecast. For example: certain historical analyses can escape \
from narrative fallacies since they can be subjected to empirical rejection \
by documents and archeological evidence (Elster).

Do not confuse or judge by intention and reasoning as opposed to results. \
Example: a binary belief should map to a payoff under scaling or \
renormalization to probability space. A belief or prediction with two \
distinct outcomes map to the expectation of a binary random variable and bets \
with payoff {0, 1}. One can then check inconsistency against arbitrage rules \
like the Dutch Book argument. This binary belief is different from real world \
open continuous payoff.

Do not confuse or conclude of collapse in binary beliefs under fat-tailed \
distributions since there is no characteristic scale.

Do not remove real outliers that can indicate fat-tails.

Do consider the possibility of simulated annealing, where one reduces the \
energy of a system slowly to a minima to find an outcome. At each time step, \
the algorithm randomly selects a solution close to the current one, measures \
its quality, and moves to it according to the temperature-dependent \
probabilities of selecting better or worse solutions, which during the search \
respectively remain at 1 (or positive) and decrease toward zero.\

Do not miss Jensen\[CloseCurlyQuote]s inequality. Nonlinearity means that \
there is at least one scale at which functions of averages, at some scale, \

Do not ignore the effects of fluctuating scales in processes i.e. \
heteroskedasticity in processes.

Do not deal with a situation in a more abstract form than required. Changes \

Do not ignore interaction from cross-dependencies.

Do not infer from the individual for aggregation to groups.

Do not validate an individual\[CloseCurlyQuote]s characteristics that is \
naively drawn from groups. Example: partisanship.

Do not ignore minority rules that have renormalization. Corollary: minorities \
rules should have visibility corresponding to payoff. Example: kosher foods.

payoff. Corollary: fallible arguments are those where the evidence used is \
sensitive to reasonable error bounds of premises. Corollary: arguments that \
with hormesis and benefit from stressors are more interesting.

Do not forecast the future by adding, but by subtracting. Example: \
prescribing exact probabilities as opposed to using subtractive knowledge to \
determine bounds.

Do not ignore noise as a result of looking backwards at history or computation.

Do not ignore the need for filtering for payoff in systems. Example: numerous \
in Skin In The Game.\[LineSeparator]
Do not use today\[CloseCurlyQuote]s norms to judge ancients. Generally, do \
not forget to check if processes are non-anticipative. One must take \
filtrations at particular times that represent all historical but not future \
information with that time. Example: journalistic anachronism of Aristotle\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s opinion of slavery. Examples: organisms can only have \
non-anticipative strategies, therefore nature can only be nonpredictive. An \
immortal organism will need to be fit for all future random events. \
Post-event adaptation will always be late, this is an incompressible time lag.

Do not do cost-benefit analyses on problems with ruin exposure. Something \
that is break irreversibility, with long enough time, will eventually break.

Do not confuse time properties and ensemble properties. Corollary, do not \
ignore ensemble possibilities or alternate histories or possibilities of ruin \
when deriving time properties. Example: using ensemble probabilities or the \
law of large numbers for investors with one life. Example: not considering \
opportunity cost.

Do not perform analyses over time when you do not do the appropriate \
adjustments owing to process dynamics. For example, of using concentration \
and changes in concentration to justify that the world is becoming less \
violent a.k.a in Steven Pinker.

Do not ignore path dependence. Example: calling people engaging in sunk cost \
fallacy when they considered paths.

Do not ignore repeated exposures in path analyses or draw conclusions on \
single episode exposure.

Do not ignore problems where forecasts can be done by bypassing evolution in \
time, these are computationally irreducible problems. Most problems are \
computationally irreducible.

Metaphors, metonymy, symbolism that usually do not exist without a reason \
that cannot be perceived. One needs to analyse the time-frame of literary \
devices and context to see if it has imperceptible information and \
distinguish it from verbalism. Exception: abused by commentators who have no \

Verbalism is the use of terms important to arguments where their meaning can \
change with context of circumstances and does not lend themselves to explicit \

labels.

\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote], \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]modern\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote], \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]populist\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote], \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]sectarian\

(1.1) Terms that require scale and degree: Examples: rate of change meant by \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]progressive\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote], rate of autarky \
in \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]globalist\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]. Especially in \
discussions where there is normalisation mechanics. Example: taken over by \
intolerant asymmetric minority (kosher foods) 
Example: \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]conservative\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] means \
backward resisting all progress. Hayek\[CloseCurlyQuote]s separation from \
verbalistic notion of conservatism.

(2) Well-defined and rigid terms that does not correspond with their meaning. \
Examples include \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]correlation\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote], \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]volatility\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote], \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]regression\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

(3) Terms stretched outside their original meaning: \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]nazi\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote], \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]fascist\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote], \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]racist\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]. Examples: bigoteering \
in general calling someone racist, chauvinist when not warranted. Second \
order siding with bigoteers is just as bad. Another example is retrospective \
bigoteering.

(4) Expressions without statistical significance: \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]evidence\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote], \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]causal\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote].

(5) Circular terms: ones that are explained by other terms that loop back to \
the same source. Example: \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]rationality\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] without mapping to the proper axiomatic framework of \
rationality.

(6) Words that do not have a robust mapping because they can have an \
arbitrary gerrymandered (boundaries of definition is manipulated and picked \
to work) definition that, not being, robust, changes according to periods. \
Examples include: \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Western civilization\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote], \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]East-West divide\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

(7) Substitution of one term for another. Examples: \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]democracy\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] with implication of \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]governance\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote], or \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]legal\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] for \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]ethical\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

(8) Distinctions without a difference but presented as a matter of substance \
are verbalistic if the terms do not have rigidity of meaning. Note: \
distinctions can be with and without differences depending on contexts and \
uses.

(9) Euphemisms and exaggeration in rigorous thought.

(10) Ambiguous labels that can fool people. 

Example: \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]\.08Holy Roman Empire\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] \
was not a continuation of the Roman Empire (Byzantium was) but the name is \
potent enough to confuse people to believing the original (mostly) \
Franco-German European union that was the continuation of ancient Rome. 

Example: \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Arab\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] as a designation \
that could mean a Westerner (i.e. Mediterranean) or \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]foreigner\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] for Arabians and \
Peninsular people, while understood as \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]nomad\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] by some. Confuses people into political theories \
such as \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Arab nationalism\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

Examples: pedophrastry or using children to prop up arguments.\
