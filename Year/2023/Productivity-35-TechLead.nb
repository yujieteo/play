more responsibility. You owe it to yourself to see how far you go. So even at \
Google, people stay 3.2 years. Internal tools in Google. People in the same \
companies. Plenty of people wanted to feel certified. Think about the overall \
lifestyle.\n\nKeep commits small. Small size code diffs will change.\nKeep \
your code modular; submit small, targeted pieces. It helps in code review and \
ensures you\[CloseCurlyQuote]re on the right track.\nAvoid crazy, tangled \
code. Write a design doc to plan your code structure and avoid messy logic.\n\
Focus on effectiveness. Keep an eye on the bigger picture, set goals, and \
ensure your code ships. Aim for at least one code submission per day.\nMake \
sure your code ships.\nClear roadblocks for that. Focus on Action Per Minute.\
\nArrogance leads to over-engineering. Beware of arrogance. Don\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t over-complicate your code to look smart. Swallow your \
pride, ask for help, and learn from experienced developers.\nIdentify and \
respect your tech lead. It\[CloseCurlyQuote]s crucial to know who holds the \
lead role and collaborate effectively.\n\nConsistency, experience, and a \
breadth of knowledge in programming\nis important. A great engineer has \
validation, impact, entrepreneurship, and marketing are crucial aspects of \
being a successful coder, going beyond technical skills alone. There is a \
need for product and marketing focus in today\[CloseCurlyQuote]s competitive \
environment. A great engineer involves turning skills into products, bringing \
them to market, and delivering impact. \n\nBody deterioration. Get exercise \
in and sleep routine. Break every 30 minutes. Go out for lunch to get \
sunshine. It is like a sport star. Get it done attitude. Get it shipped. Get \
productive at any Apple store. Open source culture. Keep it simple and \
consistency. There is a mix of collaboration and solo activity.\n\nCheck \
official tutorial from the website chapter by chapter. Read the official \
tutorials. Official language guide has no gaps. Read first few chapters. Skim \
through advanced topics. Python is on the backend. Swift. Kotlin. Javascript. \
Every language you will eventually forget.\nReading is faster to jump around.\
\n\nYou will only have one language and that is the one you used.\>\""}],
