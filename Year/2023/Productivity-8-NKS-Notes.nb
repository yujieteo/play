great effort into explaining things in straightforward ways.\n\n But to get \
to the point of being able to do this has taken me twenty years of gradually \
building up from specific detailed results and ideas. And I have no doubt \
that in the future essentially all significant contributions will also be \
made by building on foundations of specific detailed facts. \n \n",

Perhaps most annoying to those with a copyediting orientation will be my \
predilection for starting sentences with conjunctions. The main reason I have \
done this is to break up what would otherwise be extremely long sentences.

Also annoying to some will be my widespread use of short paragraphs. In the \
main text I normally follow the principle that any paragraph should \
communicate just one basic idea. And my hope is then that after reading each \
paragraph readers will pause a moment to absorb each idea before going on to \
the next one.

 So to make this book as broadly accessible as possible what I mostly do is \
in the main text to discuss ideas as directly as I can\[LongDash]but then in \
these notes to outline their historical context. 

Sometimes clarity demands that I say explicitly that something from the past \
is wrong, but generally I try to avoid this, preferring instead just to state \
whatever I now believe is true.

To get a deeper understanding, however, one invariably needs to try \
formulating experiments for oneself. One might wonder, for example, what \
would happen if some particular system were run for more steps than I show in \
this book. Would the system go on doing what one sees in the book, or might \
it start doing something quite different? With the appropriate setup, one can \
immediately run a program to find out. Often one will have some kind of guess \
about what the answer should be. At first\[LongDash]if my own experience is a \
guide\[LongDash]this guess will quite often be wrong. But gradually, after \
seeing what happens in enough cases, one will begin to develop a correct and \
robust new intuition. Realistically this seems to take several months even \
for the most talented and open-minded people. 

When one learns a language - at least as a young child - one implicitly tends \
to deduce simple grammatical rules that are in effect specific \
generalisations of examples one has encountered. And I suspect that in doing \
this the types of generalisations that one makes are essentially those that \
correspond to the types of similarities that one readily recognizes in \
retrieving data from memory.

But most of the time nothing like it will be possible. And \
instead\[LongDash]just as in any other framework\[LongDash]there will be no \
choice but first to learn all sorts of details of a system, and then to use \
judgement and creativity to see which of them are really essential to a model \
and which are not.\
