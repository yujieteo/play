Ignoring silent attributes of a process.

Example (History of Private Life): No historical study or account should be \
considered without filling-in the gaps of non-events, or events that do not \
reflect the agency of some top-down ruler or \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]leader\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote].

Example (boring peace ignored in history) Historical accounts are, by their \
very structure, biased to overestimate agency in human affairs (such as the \
role of \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]leaders\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] and the \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]state\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]), as well as conflicts \
dealt with from the top, as well as the devaluation of the properties of the \
system. By their very focus on wars, historians see history as wars \
punctuated with episodes of peace, not peace punctuated with episodes of war. \
This mis-focus increase representativeness, exaggerates the role of meetings, \
decisions, and recorded \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]events\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]. By their very \
definition recorded events are not random samples but glorifications of \
salient happenings.

Example (via positiva leadership) \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Leadership\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] is merely procedural Evolution (hence improvement) \
never happen from the top via positiva. But degradation takes place from the \
top via interventionism and side effects of policies. And improvement from \
the top is necessarily obtained via negativa. This ignores contributions from \
the collective or the ensemble.

Example (survival bias): ignoring those that did not survive.

Example (opaque heuristics): routines performed by society that does not seem \
to make sense that has been done for a long time and sticks for unknown \
reasons. \

Looking at realisations as opposed to the fundamental generator.

Specific deterministic and random interactions between components \
\[Dash]owing to dependence produce different behaviors from those of the \
properties seen in isolation, particularly when asymmetric. These \
cross-dependencies produce different outputs depending on the scale. 

Change in size or quantities transforms the problems. No situation should \
ever be dealt with in more abstract form than required. Life is about a \
collection or particulars that do not necessarily generalize without scale \
transformation.

Example: John Ioannidis found out that the odds for an elderly to die on the \
road exceeds that from Covid-19 (the statistical claim was effectively wrong, \
but let\[CloseCurlyQuote]s ignore). Consider a collective, that is a sum of \
individuals. Because deaths on the road are independent (hence allow for the \
workings of CLT, the central limit theorem) and the ones from Covid dependent \
(hence do not scale by CLT), you witness a reversal of the source of risk. \
How? The odds of a 100 elderly dying from Covid exceed the odds of the same \
number dying in car accident, even if one person is individually more likely \
to die on the road.

Example: partisan\[CloseCurlyQuote]s individual opinion is totally invalid. \
Partisanship is representative collectively.

Example: properties of sum of random variables different from the sum of \
properties. 

Example: a country is not a large village, a city state is not a small \
empire, a collective is not the a naive sum of individuals. 

Example: Note that people live under the illusion that if science works in \
getting us closer to truth, it is the result of the fact that on balance \
individual scientists are attempting to get us closer to truth. This is \
clearly false under scale transformation; it is similar to the aggregative \
properties of markets: scientists might be just trying to pursue \
self-interest and it is the rules that allow the truth to progress in spite \
of the attributes of the individuals.

Example (from physical sciences): mean-field theory, renormalization groups

Example (from statistics): ignoring pre-asymptotics or the slowness of the \
law of large numbers.

Example (false comparisons of scales): GMO to junk food

Example (nudging): nudging rules on individual does not translate to results \
on collective.
For instance, nudging people into investing their retirement savings into \
basket strategies might be beneficial for a single individual taken in \
isolation, but will not translate into benefits for the collective \[Dash]it \
will remove the effects of diversification.

Example (golden rules): Avoid golden rules. Golden rules (\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]treat others the
way you\[CloseCurlyQuote]d like to be treated\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]) invite \
busybodies to change other people\[CloseCurlyQuote]s lives.

Example (invisible minority rules): minority rules undergo scale \
transformation due to renormalization, they need to be visible due to the \
outsized effect.

Counterexamples for coercion: 
Exceptions in the tails of the distributions:
- seat belts
- taxation (mandatory)
- bioethics (can\[CloseCurlyQuote]t sell my own kidney if I wanted)
- education (children coerced to learn even in homeschooling)
- army (in war to defend nation)
- treatments (e.g. drug addicts)
- jury duty (mandatory)

Example: Group morality is not the sum of individual morality. Never make \
moral inferences about an aggregate or a group from attributes of individual \
members and vice versa. Under adequate legal and institutional structure, the \
intentions and morality of individual agents does not aggregate to groups. \
And the reverse: attributes of groups do not map to those of agents.\

Racism vs. Xenophobia. Racism has
two conditions: 1) imparting population attributes to randomly selected \
individuals or sub-groups from such a population; that is, in the association \
of abilities, personality traits, and disposition with ethnicities and \
classification. It leads to treating a person with presumed population traits \
rather than the idiosyncratic ones (that is, top down vs bottom up).
2) holding the belief that such presumed population traits and dispositions \
are inferior to one\[CloseCurlyQuote]s own.

Homophily consists in preferring people similar to one-
self for social or cultural purposes, though not political,
economic, or functional ones (where its pathology becomes
nepotism).

Xenophobia consists in pathological homophily, disliking strangers qua \
strangers.

Example: Giving favorable treatment or inheritance to a relative or a family \
member cannot be considered racism although the link with that person is \
primarily genetic, particularly if the person is recently discovered half \
sibling. On the other hand claiming to be giving such favorable treatment \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]because of skills\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] is racist \
and eugenist. Granting a French citizenship to a newborn issue of French \
parents in Mongolia while not doing so with other babies in the same hospital \

 "Verbalism is the use of terms important to arguments where their meaning \
can change with context of circumstances and does not lend themselves to \
explicit definitions. \n\nNote that scholars do not need to produce \
codification to expressions used, but must be able to back-up every single \
term used.\n\nThe problem is not using labels as shortcuts. The problem is \
thinking in terms of labels.\n\nVerbalisms do not have rigidity of meaning. \
The criterion of rigidity of meaning is sufficient to spot verbalism. Some \
examples include:\n\n(1) Ill-defined terms: \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]freedom of \
speech\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote], \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]globalist\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote], \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]conservative\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote], \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]progressive\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote], \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]liberal\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote], \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]modern\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote], \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]populist\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote], \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]sectarian\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\n(1.1) Terms that require ",
 StyleBox["scale and degree",
  FontWeight->"Bold"],
 ": rate of change meant by \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]progressive\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote], rate of autarky in \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]globalist\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]. Especially in discussions where there is \
normalisation mechanics. Example: taken over by intolerant asymmetric \
minority (kosher foods) \nExample: \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]conservative\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] means backward resisting all progress. Hayek\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s separation from verbalistic notion of conservatism.\n\n\
(2) Well-defined and rigid terms that does not correspond with their meaning. \
Examples include \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]correlation\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote], \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]volatility\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote], \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]regression\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\n\n(3) Terms \
stretched outside their original meaning: \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]nazi\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote], \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]fascist\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote], \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]racist\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\n\n(4) Expressions \
without statistical significance: \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]evidence\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote], \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]causal\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]. This is scientism.\n\n(5) Circular terms: ones that \
are explained by other terms that loop back to the same source. Example: \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]rationality\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] without mapping to \
the proper axiomatic framework of rationality.\n\n(6) Words that do not have \
a robust mapping because they can have an arbitrary gerrymandered (boundaries \
of definition is manipulated and picked to work) definition that, not being, \
robust, changes according to periods. Examples include: \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Western civilization\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote], \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]East-West divide\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\n\n(7) \
Substitution of one term for another. Examples: \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]democracy\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] with implication of \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]governance\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote], or \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]legal\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] for \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]ethical\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\n\n(8) Distinctions \
without a difference but presented as a matter of substance are verbalistic \
if the terms do not have rigidity of meaning. Note: distinctions can be with \
and without differences depending on contexts and uses.\n\n(9) Euphemisms and \
exaggeration in rigorous thought.\n\n(10) Ambiguous labels that can fool \
people. \n\nExample: \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]\.08Holy Roman Empire\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] was not a continuation of the Roman Empire \
(Byzantium was) but the name is potent enough to confuse people to believing \
the original (mostly) Franco-German European union that was the continuation \
of ancient Rome. \n\nExample: \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Arab\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] as a designation that could mean a Westerner (i.e. \
Mediterranean) or \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]foreigner\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] \
for Arabians and Peninsular people, while understood as \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]nomad\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] by some. Confuses people \
into political theories such as \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Arab nationalism\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\n\nExamples: bigoteering in general calling someone \
racist, chauvinist when not warranted. Exploiting verbalisms. Second order \
siding with bigoteers is also as bad. Also, retrospective bigoteering.\n\n\
Examples: pedophrastry or using children to prop up arguments."
