 StyleBox["\n\nIn practice, it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s often critical to create \
visualizations of inputs or outputs. Yes, everything can be represented as an \
explicit symbolic expression. But we humans often have a much easier time \
understanding things when they\[CloseCurlyQuote]re presented visually, rather \
than as some kind of one-dimensional language-like string. \n\nIn a sense, \
this is a simple, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]computationally reducible\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] solution\[LongDash]that for example we can easily \
understand. But there\[CloseCurlyQuote]s potentially a much better solution, \
at least if we\[CloseCurlyQuote]re able to make use of sophisticated \
computation. Given the complete pattern of who wants to go where, we can \
dispatch specific vehicles to drive in whatever complicated arrangement is \
needed to optimally deliver people to their destinations. It won\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t be like the trains, with their regular times. Instead, it\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]ll be something that looks more complex, and \
computationally irreducible. And it won\[CloseCurlyQuote]t be easy to \
characterize in terms of numbers.\n\nPart of that expansion is actually a \
matter of technology. We\[CloseCurlyQuote]re building telescopes and \
microscopes and amplifiers that allow us to extend our raw human senses to be \
sensitive to more things. But there\[CloseCurlyQuote]s also another part of \
the expansion that is in effect intellectual: we\[CloseCurlyQuote]re \
developing new conceptual frameworks that allow us to \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]corral\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] things we see happening \
in the world into forms that \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]fit narratives\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] we\[CloseCurlyQuote]ve constructed.\n\nIt\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s worth understanding that in our models, not everything \
that \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]goes on in the universe\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] \
can necessarily be best characterized in terms of particles. In principle one \
might be able to think of every piece of activity in the network as somehow \
related to a sufficiently small or short-lived \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]particle\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]. But mostly there won\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t be \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]room \
for\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] the characteristics of something we can identify \
as a particular \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]countable\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] \
particle to emerge.\n\nSo, in the end, how is it that things can move? \
Ultimately it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s something that has to be formally derived \
from the underlying model, based on the characteristics of the observer. At \
least conceptually the first step is to identify what kinds of things the \
observer considers \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]the same\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote], \
and what details make them \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]seem different\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]. Then one needs to determine whether there are \
structures that would be considered the same by the observer, but which \
progressively change \[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]where they\[CloseCurlyQuote]re \
embedded\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]. And if so, we\[CloseCurlyQuote]ve \
identified \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]motion\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote].\n\nSo are \
there in fact robust structures that can \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]move across \
rulial space\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]? The answer, I think, is yes. But it\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s a strange story. I suspect that the analog in rulial \
space of particles in physical space is basically concepts\[LongDash]say of \
the kind that might be represented by words in a human (or computational) \
language.\n\nBut just like our examples of motion, the way this works depends \
on the characteristics of the observers observing it\[LongDash]and insofar as \
we are the observers, it therefore depends on us. We know from experience \
that we form concepts, and that they have a certain robustness. But why is \
this? In a sense, concepts are a way of coarse-graining things so that we\
\[LongDash]as computationally bounded entities\[LongDash]can deal with them. \
And the fact that we take concepts to maintain some kind of fixed meaning is \
part of our perception that we maintain a single persistent thread of \
experience.\n\nWhat does the concept of the ruliad mean for the fundamental \
way we think about things like science? The typical conception of \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]what science does\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] is that it\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s about us figuring out\[LongDash]as \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]objectively\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] as we can\
\[LongDash]how the world happens to be. But the concept of the ruliad in a \
sense turns this on its head.\n\nBecause it says that at some ultimate level, \
everything is a matter of abstract necessity. And it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s just \
our \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]parsing\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] of it that defines \
the subject matter of what we call science. We might have thought that the \
science of the universe was just something that\[CloseCurlyQuote]s \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]out there\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]. But what we\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]re realizing is that instead in some fundamental sense, it\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s all \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]on us\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote].\
\n\nBut does that mean that there\[CloseCurlyQuote]s no \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]objective truth\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote], and nothing \
that can robustly be said about the universe without \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]passing it through us\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]? Well, \
no. Because what we\[CloseCurlyQuote]ve discovered through our Physics \
Project is that actually there are quite global things that can (\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]objectively\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]) be said about our \
universe and the laws it follows, as perceived by observers like us. \n\nIt\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s interesting to notice that for an observer like us, there \
seem to be only a finite set of types of \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]elementary \
particles\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] that exist in physical space. And perhaps \
that\[CloseCurlyQuote]s not unrelated to the fact that observers like us also \
seem to imagine that there are in some sense only a finite number of \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]basic concepts\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] (associated, \
say, with distinct words in human languages). There\[CloseCurlyQuote]s lots \
more detail that exists in rulial space\[LongDash]or in the \
ruliad\[LongDash]but for observers like us, with our type of way of sampling \
the ruliad, these might be core coherent structures that we perceive. \n\nIt\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s a similar problem in natural science. You see some \
elaborate set of things happening in some biological system. Can one \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]reverse engineer\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] these to find \
an \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]explanation\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] for them? \
Sometimes one might be able to say, for example, that evolution by natural \
selection would be likely to lead to something. Or that it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s \
just common in the computational universe and so is likely to occur. But \
there\[CloseCurlyQuote]s no guarantee that the natural world is set up in any \
way that necessarily allows human explanation.\n\nNeedless to say, when one \
makes models for things, one inevitably considers only the particular aspects \
that one\[CloseCurlyQuote]s interested in, and idealizes everything else \
away. And particularly in areas like medicine, it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s not \
uncommon to end up with some approximate model that\[CloseCurlyQuote]s a \
fairly shallow decision tree that\[CloseCurlyQuote]s easy to explain, at \
least as far as it goes.\n\nIn the design of the Wolfram \
Language\[LongDash]with functions named with English words\[LongDash]I \
leverage the \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]ambient understanding\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] that comes from the English words (and sometimes \
from their meanings in common applications of computation). \n\nWill we call \
this \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]mathematics\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]? I think we \
should. But it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s a different tradition from what we\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]ve mostly used for the past millennium. \
It\[CloseCurlyQuote]s one where we can still build abstractions, and we can \
still construct new levels of understanding. \n\nIt\[CloseCurlyQuote]s a \
nontrivial fact of physics that \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]pure motion\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] in physical space is possible; in other words, that \
an \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]object\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] can be moved \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]without change\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] from one place \
in physical space to another. And now, in a sense, we\[CloseCurlyQuote]re \
asking about pure motion in rulial space: can we move something \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]without change\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] from one mind \
at one place in rulial space to another mind at another place? In physical \
space, things like particles\[LongDash]as well as things like black holes\
\[LongDash]are the fundamental elements that are imagined to move without \
change. So what\[CloseCurlyQuote]s now the analog in rulial space? It seems \
to be concepts\[LongDash]as often, for example, represented by words. \n\nIt\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s also possible to think about a kind of inverse question: \
just what is the extent of a mind in rulial space? Or, in other words, what \
range of points of view, ultimately about the ruliad, can it hold? Will it be \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]narrow-minded\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote], able to think \
only in particular ways, with particular concepts? Or will it be more \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]broad-minded\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote], encompassing \
more ways of thinking, with more concepts?\n\nIt\[CloseCurlyQuote]s all \
connected to the idea of semantic grammar\[LongDash]and the goal of having a \
generic symbolic \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]construction kit\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] for concepts, that would give us rules for what \
could fit together with what, and thus for the \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]flow\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] of what we might turn into human language. \n\nWith \
the concept of the ruliad we finally have a principled way to talk about \
alien minds\[LongDash]at least at a theoretical level. And the key point is \
that any alien mind\[LongDash]or, for that matter, any mind\[LongDash]can be \
thought of as \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]observing\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] or \
sampling the ruliad from its own particular point of view, or in effect, its \
own position in rulial space.\n\nPotentially it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s like what \
we\[CloseCurlyQuote]d normally consider a concept\[LongDash]or something to \
which we might assign a word in human language. If we have ways of thinking\
\[LongDash]or consciousnesses\[LongDash]whose details are different, the \
issue is what will be robust enough to be able to be transported between \
them. And what everyday experience seems to suggest is that the answer is \
concepts. Even though one might have a slightly different way of thinking, \
what one calls \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]a fish\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] (or \
essentially, the concept of a fish) is something that can still robustly be \
communicated.\n\nOne might think that a multiway graph that captures all \
possibilities would inevitably be too complicated to be useful. But this is \
another key observation from our Physics Project: particularly with the \
phenomenon of causal invariance, there are generic statements that can be \
made, without dealing with all the details. And one of the important \
directions we\[CloseCurlyQuote]ve pursued over the course of this year is to \
get a better understanding\[LongDash]sometimes using methods from category \
theory\[LongDash]of the general theory of multiway systems.\n\nWhen we first \
asked the question \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Why does the universe exist?\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] it seemed difficult to understand how one could \
possibly make an abstract argument that would conclude anything about the \
existence of the particular universe in which we seem to find ourselves. But \
the key point is that the full rulial universe involves no particular \
choices; it is something formally inevitable. But what we perceive as our \
universe is just a part of that full rulial universe, and a part determined \
by the particulars of how we\[LongDash]with our \
consciousness\[LongDash]choose to describe the world.\n\nBut while all of \
these look like surfaces, they\[CloseCurlyQuote]re all obviously different. \
And one way to characterize them is by their local curvature. Well, it turns \
out that in our models, curvature is a concept closely related to dimension\
\[LongDash]and this fact will actually be critical in understanding, for \
example, how gravity arises.\n\nIn the end it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s wonderfully \
elegant. But to get to the point where we can understand the elegant bigger \
picture we need to go through some detailed things. (It \
isn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t terribly surprising that a fundamental theory of \
physics\[LongDash]inevitably built on very abstract ideas\[LongDash]is \
somewhat complicated to explain, but so it goes.)\n\nAnd, yes, this kind of \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]dictionary \
compression\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\[Dash]like scheme is useful in bringing a \
first level of explainability.\n\nBut let\[CloseCurlyQuote]s go back to the \
proof of my axiom system. The lemmas that were generated in this proof are \
precisely set up to be elements that are used repeatedly (a bit like shared \
common subexpressions). But even having in effect factored them out, we\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]re still left with a proof that is not something that we \
humans can readily understand.\n\nSo how can we go further? Well, basically \
we have to come up with some yet-higher-level description. But what might \
this be?\n\nThe Concept of Concepts\n\nIf you\[CloseCurlyQuote]re trying to \
explain something to somebody, it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s a lot easier when there\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s something similar that they\[CloseCurlyQuote]ve already \
understood. Imagine trying to explain a modern drone to someone from the \
Stone Age. It\[CloseCurlyQuote]d probably be pretty difficult. But explaining \
it to someone from 50 years ago, who\[CloseCurlyQuote]d already seen \
helicopters and model airplanes etc., would be a lot easier. \n\nAnd \
ultimately the point is that when we explain something, we do it in some \
language that both we and whoever we\[CloseCurlyQuote]re explaining it to \
know. And the richer this language is, the fewer new elements we have to \
introduce in order to communicate whatever it is that we\[CloseCurlyQuote]re \
trying to explain. \n\nSo to understand our experience, what we need to ask \
is how a \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]branching brain\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] will \
perceive a \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]branching universe\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]. \
And the story is remarkably similar to what we discussed above for our \
experience of space and time: it all has to do with imagining ourselves to \
have a certain definite persistence.\n\nIn other words, if you want to move \
in rulial space, you can do it by putting in the appropriate computational \
work to change your conceptual point of view (or, essentially equivalently, \
your language for describing things). So what about curvature (or the analog \
of gravity) in rulial space\[LongDash]say generated through an analog of \
Einstein\[CloseCurlyQuote]s equations from density of activity in rulial \
space? Presumably this relates to the difficulty\[LongDash]or time it takes\
\[LongDash]to get from one place in rulial space, and one way of thinking, to \
another. And conceivably things like \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]paradigm shifts\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] between different ways of thinking might be \
associated with features of rulial space like event horizons.\n\nIn \
constructing the ruliad, one is in a sense going to a more extreme version of \
multicomputation, in which one uses not just a particular rule with multiple \
outcomes, but all possible rules. In effect, the concept is to use \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]maximal nondeterminism\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote], and at \
each step to independently \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]pick whatever rule one \
wants\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote], tracing out a rulial multiway system that \
includes all the different possible paths this generates. \n\nOne of the \
conceptual difficulties in thinking about how we perceive the ruliad is that \
it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s a story of \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]self-observation\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]. Essentially by the very definition of the ruliad, \
we ourselves are part of it. We never get to \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]see the \
whole ruliad from the outside\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]. We only get to \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]experience it from the inside\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote].",
