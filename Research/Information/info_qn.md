DAYDREAMS K COMPLEXITY

Need to motivate the achievability lemmas: typical average, joint typicality, packing, covering, conditional typicality?

McMillan inequality

Strong typicality? Orlitsky-Roche definition? Why so significant?

Occam algorithm intuition?

Uniquely decodable code?

Monotone reference machine?

Why must Turing machine need to use blanks?

Multi-access channel?

Instantaneous code? Uniquely decodable code? Huffman code? Prefix code?

Fanoâ€™s inequality? Proof? Motivation (hint: channel coding theorem)

Entropy rate of stationary Markov chain?

Theorems for rate distortion function? Calculations?

Minimax theorem for word length?

Lempel-Ziv coding?

How is variance equal to power for maximal differential entropy under average power constraint?

Packing lemma motivation? Multi source channels?

Covering lemma?

Capacity with cost? How is the cost applied?

Additive White Gaussian Noise channel?
